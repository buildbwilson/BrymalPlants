A simple post to demonstrate how a normal blog post looks on Hylia. Content is all set in the “Body” field as markdown and Eleventy transforms it into a proper HTML post. You can also edit the markdown file directly if you prefer not to use the CMS.


> Website has officially launched! Here is a sample quote talking about this importance.

A list of stuff:

- How do lists work?
- Am i really able to just use the simple line '-' ?
- I will make a bullet after this one to confirm
- This hopefully shows.....

How about an ordered list of stuff: Does this text look different?

1. Get the bag
2. Populate the world with quality cheap plants
3. Spend all my money making nature better?
4.
5. Profit?????


Hopefully, this works with a quick save lmao.
